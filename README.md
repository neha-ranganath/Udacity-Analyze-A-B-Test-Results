# Udacity-Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

For this project, the goal was to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The aim was understand if the company should implement a new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make their decision.
